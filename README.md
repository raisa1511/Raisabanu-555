The code is a comprehensive implementation of a time series forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It generates synthetic multivariate time series data, preprocesses it, and trains an LSTM model to forecast future values. The code also includes hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics, and SHAP values for explainability.
